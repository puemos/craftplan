The CRM module provides a customer database integrated with orders and billing.

## Customer Database

Navigate to **Manage → Customers** to see all customers. Each customer record includes:

![Customers List](/craftplan/screenshots/customers.webp)

- Name and contact information
- Company name (optional)
- Notes

## Addresses

Customers can have multiple addresses for:

- **Shipping** — Delivery destination for orders
- **Billing** — Invoice address

Addresses are selected when creating orders and appear on generated invoices.

## Order History

Each customer profile shows a complete order history:

- All orders placed by the customer
- Order statuses and delivery dates
- Total order value

This gives you a quick view of the relationship without leaving the customer page.

## Statistics

Customer profiles include summary statistics:

- Total number of orders
- Total revenue from the customer
- Most frequently ordered products
- Average order value

These metrics help identify your most valuable customers and their purchasing patterns.

## CSV Export

Customer data can be exported to CSV from **Manage → Settings** for use in external CRM tools, mailing lists, or reporting.
