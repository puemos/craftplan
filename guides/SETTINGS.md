## General

- Default currency: choose the currency used to format prices and totals throughout the app.

## Allergens

- Manage the master list of allergens used by materials.
- Materials can reference allergens; products inherit allergens through their recipes.

## Nutritional Facts

- Manage the master list of nutritional facts (e.g., protein, carbs, sugar).
- Materials can define amounts per unit; products aggregate totals via recipes.

## Best Practices

- **Review Settings**: Periodically review your settings (currency, allergens, nutritional facts)
- **Test Changes**: After changing settings, confirm they reflect correctly in product and inventory views
