Craftplan Product Plan -- Bakery ERP Roadmap

Last updated: 2025-10-25

Progress Snapshot

- Overall: [ ] Not started / [x] In progress / [ ] Done
- Current Cycle (Oct 2025): Stabilize internal print flows + prep costing foundations.
- Active Initiative: Inventory Forecast Grid Milestone B (LiveView controls + metrics band).
- Milestone Health
  - [ ] M1: Production Costing Foundations
  - [ ] M2: Traceability & Compliance
  - [x] M3: Inventory Planning & Purchasing
  - [ ] M4: Commerce & Channel Sync (Optional)
  - [ ] M5: Insights & Pricing Intelligence
  - [ ] M6: Onboarding & Adoption

Recently Completed

- Planner split into Overview/Schedule tabs; schedule calendar isolates day view.
- Over-capacity highlights in planner with metrics modal across tabs.
- Make Sheet print view hides navigation and actions; invoice printable HTML scaffolded.
- Product capacity (`max_daily_quantity`) enforced at checkout alongside global capacity.
- Public storefront retired in favor of a login-first screen; capacity/tax/fulfillment settings remain for internal planning.
- CSV import LiveComponent refactor with reusable wizard, per-entity configs, and LiveView tests.
- Orders and Inventory LiveViews aligned to settings-inspired layout primitives with shared components.

Competitive Insights -- Craftybase Highlights

- Multi-stage BOMs with components/sub-assemblies and labor costing; generates real-time cost rollups and pricing suggestions.
- Compliance and traceability tooling: lot/batch tracking, recall workflows, audit-friendly reports.
- Location-aware inventory with stock transfers, consignment tracking, and guided stocktake/cycle count tooling.
- Automated COGS calculations (GAAP/IRS aligned) feeding reports and profitability dashboards.
- Integrated channel sync (Shopify, Etsy, Square, Faire, Wix, WooCommerce, Amazon Handmade) with real-time stock updates.
- Templates and calculators (pricing, production planning) supporting onboarding and ongoing price optimization.

Guiding Principles

- Operate -> Make -> Stock remains the primary loop; extend with costing and compliance primitives rather than bespoke workflows.
- Self-host friendly and offline tolerant: webhooks/integrations should degrade gracefully to CSV or manual sync.
- Favor declarative Ash resources and LiveView streams; keep imperative logic in services only when needed.
- Every new surface must support printable artifacts (labels, planner, invoices, compliance reports).

Milestone 1 -- Production Costing Foundations (2-3 weeks)
Status: [ ] Not started [x] In progress [ ] Done
Goals

- Match competitor parity on multi-stage recipes, labor costing, and automated batch cost rollups.
- Provide pricing guidance hooks that later feed Insights.

User Stories

- As a product developer, I build a BOM with components, sub-assemblies, and labor entries.
- As an operator, completing a batch generates actual cost per unit and suggested price ranges.
- As a planner, I see batch codes auto-generated when marking production done.

Requirements

- Domain
  - [x] New Ash resources for BOM structures: `Catalog.BOM`, `Catalog.BOMComponent`, `Catalog.LaborStep` with versioning.
  - [x] Link BOM to `Catalog.Product`; support status (`draft`, `active`).
  - [x] Labor rates and overhead settings in `Settings` (hourly rate, markup defaults).
  - [x] Batch cost calculation service generating `material_cost`, `labor_cost`, `overhead_cost`, `unit_cost`.
  - [x] Auto-generate `batch_code` (`B-YYYYMMDD-SKU-SEQ`) when order items marked done; persist to order items.
- UI
  - [ ] BOM editor LiveView with step builder, sub-assembly selector, labor entries.
  - [ ] Planner ‚ÄúMark Done‚Äù dialog shows resulting batch code and actual cost snapshot.
  - [ ] Pricing helper card on product detail showing suggested retail/wholesale prices (based on markup settings).
- Data & Migrations
  - [x] Tables for BOMs/components/labor; migrations keep existing products unaffected until BOM assigned.
  - [x] Backfill seeds with example recipes (bread, pastry) including labor.

Deprecations & Removals (no backward compatibility)

- [ ] Remove legacy Recipe model usage in domain and UI
  - [ ] Switch Product label ingredients to BOM components (fallback not required)
  - [ ] Replace product financial calculations to prefer active BOM unit cost; remove recipe-based cost calcs
  - [ ] Remove Recipe editor UI and tabs (`ProductLive.FormComponentRecipe`, show routes/tabs)
  - [ ] Remove `Catalog.Recipe` and `Catalog.RecipeMaterial` resources from `Craftplan.Catalog`
  - [ ] Drop `catalog_recipes` and `catalog_recipe_materials` tables via migration
- [ ] Replace `Material <-> Recipe` relationships with `Material <-> BOM` through `BOMComponent`
- [ ] Update planner/forecasting to load from BOMs instead of Recipes
- [ ] Update seeds/tests to use BOMs exclusively; remove recipe fixtures
- [ ] Remove any documentation and references to Recipes

Acceptance Criteria

- Batch completion persists cost breakdown and batch code on order item; totals flow into invoices.
- Pricing helper toggles between markup types (percent/fixed) and respects inclusive/exclusive tax.
- BOM editor enforces valid graphs (no cycles) and supports saving draft vs publish.

Implementation Notes

- Consider `Ash.Flow` for multi-step BOM creation to reuse validations.
- Add unit tests for cost calculator (material shrinkage, multi-step components).
- Update documentation in guides for BOM/labor usage.
